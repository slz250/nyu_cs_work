To run type in command line:

M, the machine size in words.
P, the page size in words.
S, the size of a process.
J, the ‘‘job mix’’, which determines A, B, and C.
N, the number of references for each process.
R, the replacement algorithm, fifo, random, or lru.
D, the debugging level.

Notes: 
*D is set to 11 no matter what you type in.
*R must be all lower case

Example command line arguments:

10 10 20 1 10 lru 0

M = 10, P = 10, S = 20, J = 1, N = 10, R = lru, D = 0

Enjoy!
